# Ashdown-Scheduling
This code can be used to efficiently construct an interview schedule for Ashdown officer recruiting.

## Using the Code for the First Time
1.  Go to www.juliabox.com.  Everything that follows in the instructions below will be done there. Use GitHub (this website) only to consult these instructions.
2.  Sign in via LinkedIn, GitHub, or Google.
3.  Clone this repository from GitHub.
    - Click the **Git** icon in the top banner of the screen.
    - In the **Git Clone URL** field, copy the following URL: https://github.com/gdowdy3/Ashdown-Scheduling.git
    - Press the [Tab] key and the other two fields should be populated automatically with **Branch: master** and **JuliaBox Folder: Ashdown-Scheduling**.
    - Click the "+" symbol to the right of the now filled fields.
    - Wait for confirmation of a successful "Git Operation".
    - Close out of the **Sync** pop-up.
4. Test run the code
    - Click on the **Ashdown-Scheduling** folder.
    - Click on the **Ashdown Interview Scheduling.ipnyb** file.  It should open in a new tab in your browser.
    - Follow the instructions there.
5. Inspect the output.
    - If the code ran successfully, it should have produced a file in the Ashdown-Scheduling Folder called "Composite Schedule.csv".
    - Save this file to your computer.
      - Check the box next to the file name.
      - Click the **Download** button that appears above when you do so.
      - Save it to a convenient location.
   - Open the file using Excel and manipulate it as you see fit (e.g., resizing and renaming columns).
   
   
## Using the Code with Your Own Input Data
To use the code with your own input data, you just need to provide your own "Interviewee Information.csv" and "Interviewer Information.csv" files.  To do so:
1. Using Excel, create your own "Interviewee Information.csv" and "Interviewer Information.csv" files, using the provided files as examples for the required format of the data.
   - These files must be named exactly "Interviewee Information.csv" and "Interviewer Information.csv"!
2. In JuliaBox, navigate to the Ashdown-Scheduling folder.
3. Click the **Upload** button in the top right corner of the screen.
4. In the pop-up window, find and select the first file you want to upload, and click the **Open** button.
5. Repeat steps 3. and 4. for the second file.
6. Click the blue **Upload** buttons next to each file.
7. Overwrite any pre-existing files of the same.
8. Run the code, as in step 4. of the previous section.
